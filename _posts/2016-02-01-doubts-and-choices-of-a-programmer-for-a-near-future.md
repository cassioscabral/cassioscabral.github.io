## Doubts and choices of a programmer for a near future

I’ve being working with Rails and web development around 4 years now and usually jobs involved setting the server up, configure deploy, build backend, frontend and that was ok. But it bothered me. I was having what I’m calling of early-career crisis. Where should I go ? What I want to become ?

What it felt to me was that the server, deploy and backend part was only to serve my frontend, it’s just a step. But I would love spend more time on the frontend part instead of the others. Why ? well, it feels right investing my time on the UX and user interface, it’s cool, generates more value and you see something new happening all the time. You can let you creativity go wild. Using A/B testing, you tweak your app forever based on user interaction data. That is just amazing.

*Frontend is where the magic happens*

Today we got backend and API as a service already, much of the backend development is automated and most of the time you ending up doing some repetitive task that you want to automate. I got bored.

I want to say that I tried to work in both areas, exploring what I could and search a lot for other people opinion on how do they deal when choosing some specific area on web development. Thanks to all gods for Quora.com.

*As long as you don’t choose, everything remains possible (Mr. Nobody)*

Even though this movie is a terrific movie, we must choose all the time and career is a big step. It’s unpredictable where technology will take us, it’s all but very good guesses and feeling. How do you choose right ? is there a right choice here ? 

I like to think that there is a better choice for you. When you feel that this is the right choice, you enjoy doing it and if you are skeptical like I am, you can choose the better option that makes you happy. And that’s not the talk about doing what you love kind a thing. It’s just choosing something that you feel good about it.

Today I feel very happy working with frontend development, I see that the way you can build a better and easy UI using React, creating components, ES2015 making JS way more readable and beautiful, using Relay and GraphQL also made it so easy(ish) integrating with a backend that solves that first problem that I said it bothered me. I believe is a great time to be a frontend developer that cares about the user and how to generate value with your skills.
